## DotNet Core WebAPI
 The initial project structure was created with cmd line `dotnet new webapi -o AlbumServer`


## Resource Naming

We are to provide CRUD routes for albums, which implies that they have resource IDs. We'll use a composite key in the form of query params.

In a production system, we'd expect to have a GUID or some other ID assigned to each Album.

For example (a query that selects a Queen album named Jazz):
    GET /albums?artist=Queen&album=Jazz


PUT will need to be idempotent
    PUT /albums
